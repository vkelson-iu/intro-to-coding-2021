But it can also hold much more, a text \"string\", the entire contents of a book, a row from a spreadsheet, or even a connection to a web site thousands of miles away. We'll talk a lot about objects of many types, so let's not worry about the details for now. Just be aware that you can use object types that come with Python and its many libraries, or make up your very own.\n"

    "Values and Data Types\n",
    "--------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides a rich variety of data types that represent textual, numerical, and logical data values. While languages like Java and C require the programmer to *explicitly* state what the ``type`` of a data item is, Python attempts to determine the type of each data item, or *object* by inspecting the information that was entered by the programmer. \n",
    "\n",
    "A *scalar* value is one that contains exactly one entry, for example a numeric value or a *string* of text. Here we will examine some of Python's *scalar* data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Jupyter Notebook, we can enter Python code into a cell and execute it by holding down the ``SHIFT`` key and pressing the ``ENTER`` key, a sequence that we'll call ``SHIFT-ENTER``. We'll begin with several cells that contain Python code that represents scalar values. Note: in Python, any line of text that has a ``#`` character as its first printable character is a *comment*. Comments are placed in the text to document how code works, or to explain special circumstances in the code. We'll learn a lot about how to write good comments this spring!\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 5 basic scalar data types in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Integer (``int``) values are numeric values that are whole numbers. ``int`` values can have as\n",
    "    many significant figures as the programmer desires, and calculations can be made exact, as we'll\n",
    "    see shortly.\n",
    "  * Floating-point (``float``) values are numeric values that may have a fractional part. Intenally, \n",
    "    ``float`` values are represented differently than ``int`` values, and they may not be exact. \n",
    "    We will discuss the small inaccuracies and *round-off* errors that may occur later, when we \n",
    "    discuss mathematical calulations ore thoroughly.\n",
    "  * Character string (``str``) values contain printable text characters. In Python 3, all ``str`` \n",
    "    entries internally utilize the Unicode character set, which allows us to put any manner of text\n",
    "    in an ``str`` value, even emojis or non-English characters. While an ``str`` value may be separated\n",
    "    into a collection of its individual characters, each of the characters will be treated as an \n",
    "    ``str`` value. Python does not possess a separate data type for a single character, as C and Java do.\n",
    "  * Boolean (``bool``) values contain logical information. ``bool`` values may be either ``True`` or \n",
    "    ``False``. Python offers an array of capabilities for manipulating ``bool`` values and symbolic logic.\n",
    "  * And there's one weird one. There is a special scalar value that indicates that there is no data entry\n",
    "    at all. This type is called ``None``, and can be utilized in a variety of ways to indicate that a \n",
    "    data value is omitted, in a manner similar to a missing value in a spreadsheet. We'll see how ``None``\n",
    "    can be used as the course goes along.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next few cells show how these scalar types are entered in Python code. Note that when you hit \n",
    "``SHIFT-ENTER`` in these cells, Python will create a Python object and print out its value."
